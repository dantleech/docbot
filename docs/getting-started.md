Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the Exedoc tutorial.

First of all let's create a new directory and make it our current working
directory:

```shell shell exitCode=0
mkdir -p demo
```

Now create a markdown file:

``````markdown create path=demo/example.md language=markdown
```
# Hello World

This is my markdown file
```
``````
